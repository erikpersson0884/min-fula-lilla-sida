				<h3>The south geese parade </h3>
				
					<p>	
						Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. 
						Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. 
						A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. 
					</p>
				
				<h3>Honkfestival cancelled due to Covid-19  </h3>
				
					<p>
						It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. 
						Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line. 
						
						The blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. 
						The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen. 
						She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. 
						Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek.
						
						Our reporter on site have told us <q> Honk! </q>

				<h3> Politics </h3>
					<p> The geese say: <q> let there be <del datetime="2020-10-20">peace</del> <ins cite="The Goose">war</ins> </q> </p>
					
					<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 
					The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, 
					content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum 
					as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions 
					have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

						<p> Since one of the programmer Samperson's geese escaped during a update, it has roamed the web for the past months. 
						In  <time datetime="2020-09-21"> september </time> the goose came across the webpage known as W3schools. There it 
						mastered the evil sides of the web. It learned about a poweful <dfn title="Weapon of Mass Destruction"> WMD </dfn> 
						known as <code><var> !important</var></code>.Equipped with this new knowledge it went on a crusade, taking down many 
						sites and web servers. It was during this period of time the goose took	the nickname Hacker_g00se </p>
