			<h2> Orgin of the Goose </h2>
			
				
				<p>A <time datetime="-25000-13-12 07:43">long time </time> ago in a galaxy far far away the war between the mighty galaxy clans escaleted. In a lab aboard one of the Krill cililizations star cruisers 
				some scientists experimented on a new type of war method, a creature so ful of caos it could overthrow even the Brutes fom Liemburh. 
				During a Tarkish raid on the external defense poost of <abbr title="The capital planet of the Krill civilization">Helios </abbr>, the crusier was cirically hit on port side blowing a hole throw the engine room to the lab. The cruiser was
				quickly overrun by the curious now realesed geese and crashed down near the north pole of Helios. </p>
					
			
		
				
					
				<p>With so much space to spread out the geese quickly repodused into houndres of thousands. With these numbers they were able to seize an ancient Erbium extractor in the
				Witherios desert. With a clean source to erbium and a quickly growing population the geese had now became the fifth lagrest race in 
				<abbr title="The galaxy of the Hiyoords"> Menedla </abbr> and a Krill special batillion formed to evit these new threat. However the batillion was poorly trained and 
				was caught in a armbush in Keeteros pass by a Tarkish geruilla warfare group. With signifintly less space due to a growing population the geese were getting closer and
				closer to the capital of Helios. With the Krill believing the geese had been taken care of the attack came unexpected and chaos broke out. Combined with a rebellion inside
				the royal family the entire planet was now at war and stardestroyers opened fire on its own cities.  
				While have heard of this a Tarkish fleet was soon mobalised and on their way to helios. During the first encounter of the fleets a damaged atomic retardator caused the
				Tarkish crown ship to acidently split up a hole into a nearby neutron extractor making the following battle bring enough energy into the nebulosa to self-react on its own
				hydrogen and detonade. With the rulig Krill people's main fleet innihilated, minor kingdoms rose up trying to conquer smaller solar system and gaining acces to ancient
				weapons and technology.</p>

	
				<p>According to <cite>the tales</cite> <q> The trees scorch of the wind and the ground cracked of radioactivity. Space itself was burning as Menedla were lost </q>
				<br>
				With a world in ruins and a no more population to terrorize the geese boarded the last operational deep space frigate and set out to find an another civilization to take down.
					
				Millions of years late the geese sighted a planet in the mily way galaxy suitable for life. While entering the solar system the starship was badly damaged due to a collision 
				in a outer asteriod belt, sending a big asteroid into an 100 year orbit with the solar system. With the outher stabilization engines the starship...</p>

			<h2>The Clash of quack </h2>
			
				<p> The clash of quack was the beggining of the end for the Goose empire. 
				As the conflict between the ducks and geese grew stronger the goose empire 
				found themselfs cornered with the duckish armada advancing in the south and 
				western barbarian hoard diserupting their supply of Erbium. <p>

				<p>At the end the Goose empire found themselfs defeated when the ducks in alliance 
				with the human race and were able to breach the eastern sheild walls and advance
				into the Goose empire. When the ducks' northen legion had seiged control of Mound Goose the 
				battle was over and the geese militia went into involuntary exil. </p>

			<h2> The fall of the goose empire </h2>

				<p> After the geese had lost the clash of quack and the council of Goose had been shattered the 
				southern geese states declared total control of Bolcan Erbium Extractors. With the risk of economic collapse 
				the Honk and Quack tribes united in a attemped to recover control of the Windgate in order to open up a passway 
				to the Bolcans. After an ambush by the Duck of sandringham's armed forces the shattered Geese hoard became an easy
